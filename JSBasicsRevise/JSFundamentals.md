## **‚ö° Variables**

### **üî• What is a Variable :**

üëâ A variable is a container for a value

### **üî• Declaring a variable :**

To use a variable we need to create a it.we can create/decleare a variable.JavaScript has three kinds of variable declaration;

üëâ **var** , **let** , **const**

First we know about var and let

```JavaScript
var myName;
let myAge;
console.log(myName) /*Returns
undefined(As we don't initialize
a value in that container(variable))*/
```

### **üî• Initializing a variable :**

üëâ After declearing a variable we need to store some value with in it , i.e called initializing .

```JavaScript
var myName = "Pritam"
let myAge = 20;
console.log(myName); /*Returns Pritam*/
```

as we can see we can decleare & Initialize variable both `var` & `let` . But whats the difference between them let's see üëá

**‚≠ê The difference between var and let**

to know about the difference between var and let lets see more details in var and let.

here come two more important topics:

- **variable hoisting**
- **variable scoping**

let's see var first

**‚û°Ô∏è var**

The var statement declares a function-scoped or globally-scoped variable, optionally initializing it to a value. lets see an example

```JavaScript
var myAge = 18;
console.log(myAge); //returns 18
if (myAge === 18) {
  var myAge = 20;
  console.log(myAge); //returns 20
}
console.log(myAge); //returns 20
```

The last log we expected to be 18 . its not happen because the redeclearation of `myAge` in the `if` statement chage the value and as the `var` is not a block scoped its assigns the 20 value after the `if` block.

**‚û°Ô∏è let**

The let statement declares a block-scoped local variable, optionally initializing it to a value

```JavaScript
let myAge = 18;
console.log(myAge); //returns 18
if (myAge === 18) {
  let myAge = 20;
  console.log(myAge); //returns 20
}
console.log(myAge); //returns 18
```

In this case , as the let variable is block scoped so the value 20 for the `myAge` variable is blocked in the `if` statement. the global (outside of the if block) value is remain unchaged.

**‚≠ê About variable Scope**

variables have two scopes which also differs var and let(discussed above);

- **Local variable**
- **Global variable**

**‚úî Global variable :-**
When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document

```JavaScript
if (true) {
  var myAge = 18;
  console.log(myAge); //returns 18;
}
console.log(myAge); //returns 18;

/*as i use "var" so the scope of
    myage is not limited in the
    if block i.e it is in the global scope,
    thats why it returns 18 after teh block*/
```

**‚úî Local Variable:-** When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.

```JavaScript
if (true) {
  let myAge = 18;
  console.log(myAge); //returns 18;
}
console.log(myAge); //through a reference error;

/*as let is block scoped it returns value in the
  if block but in the global scope is throgh a reference error*/
```

**‚≠ê Variable Hoisting**

Another unusual thing about variables in JavaScript is that you can refer to a variable declared later, without getting an exception. <br>
This concept is known as hoisting. Variables in JavaScript are, in a sense, "hoisted" (or "lifted") to the top of the function or statement. However, variables that are hoisted return a value of `undefined`. So even if you declare and initialize after you use or refer to this variable, it still returns `undefined`. <br>
**_Because variable declarations (and declarations in general) are processed before any code is executed, and memory is allocated for each var , if in the var is no value its showed undefined_** <br>

```JavaScript
function doSomething() {
  console.log(bar); // undefined
  var bar = 111;
  console.log(bar); // 111
}
doSomething();
/*another eg.*/
console.log(x); // undefined
var x = 3;
```

**_Hoisting no longer works with `let`. If we changed var to `let` in the above example, it would fail with an error. `because the variable is in a "temporal dead zone" from the start of the block until the declaration is processed.` This is a good thing ‚Äî declaring a variable after you initialize it results in confusing, harder to understand code._**

```JavaScript
function doSomething() {
  console.log(bar); // Uncaught ReferenceError;
  let bar = 111;
  console.log(bar);
}
doSomething();
/*another eg.*/
console.log(x); // ReferenceError
let x = 3;
```

apert from scope secondly, when you use var, you can declare the same variable as many times as you like, but with let you can't. The following would work:

```JavaScript
var myName = 'Pritam';
var myName = 'Swapna'; //no error

let myName = 'Pritam';
let myName = 'Swapna'; //error
```

### **üî• Updating a variable:**

üëâ Once a variable has been initialized with a value, you can change (or update) that value by giving it a different value.

```JavaScript
let myName = 'Pritam';
myName = 'Swapna'; //updated value pritam to swapna
```

## **‚ö° Data Types**

There are two main datatypes in JS

> - **(i) Primitives**
> - **(ii) Objects**

**_(i) Primitives_** Data Types are 7 types

`Boolean :` They are `true` or `false`

`Number :` An Integer or Floating point number . e.g 32 or 32.123 . Integers are limited by `¬±(2 to the power 53 - 1)`

`String :` for strings. A string may have zero or more characters, there‚Äôs no separate single-character type.

`BigInt :` An integer with arbitrary precision. For example: 9007199254740992n.

`undefined :` A top-level property whose value is not defined.

`null :` A special keyword denoting a null value. (Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.)

`symbol :` A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.

**_(ii) Objects_** willbe discussed Later.

Examples of primitives üëá

### üëâ **Boolean**

booleans are two types true or false ; This type is commonly used to store yes/no values: true means ‚Äúyes, correct‚Äù, and false means ‚Äúno, incorrect‚Äù.

```JavaScript
let userLogIn = true; // yes , user loggedIn
let userSignUp = false; // false , user not signed In

let isGreater = 4 > 5;
console.log(isGreater); // false
let isLess = 4 < 5;
console.log(isLess); // true;
```

### üëâ **Number**

The number type represents both integer and floating point numbers.

Besides regular numbers, there are so-called ‚Äúspecial numeric values‚Äù which also belong to this data type: Infinity, -Infinity and NaN.

NaN represents a computational error.

```JavaScript
let int = 786; // Integer
let float = 77.5698; // Floating point

let inf = 1 / 0;
console.log(inf); // Infinity
let noNumber = "pritam" / 2;
console.log(
  noNumber
); /*  NaN ("pritam" is not a number so it returns
a computaional error)*/
```

### üëâ **String**

A string in JavaScript must be surrounded by quotes.
There are three kinds of quotes

- Single quotes `' '` ,
- Double quotes `" "`
- backticks `` ` ` `` ;

charaters inside these quotes are strings

```JavaScript
let firstName = "Pritam"; // Double Quoted String
let lastName = "Bera"; //Single Quoted String
let fullName = ` Your Full Name is ${firstName} ${lastName}`; // Backticks Strings

console.log(fullName); //  Your Full Name is Pritam Bera
```

More About Strings Discussed Later;

### üëâ **BigInt**

A BigInt value is created by appending n to the end of an integer:

```JavaScript
const bigInt = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n;
```

### üëâ **undefined**

The meaning of undefined is ‚Äúvalue is not assigned‚Äù.

If a variable is declared, but not assigned, then its value is undefined:

**_ undefined is different from reference error .
if variable is decleared but not value is assigened to it then it is `undefined` but if the variable is not decleard then it throughs `reference error` _**

```JavaScript
let country;
console.log(country); // undefied coz no value is assigened to country

console.log(state); // Uncaught ReferenceError: state is not defined state is decleared as a variable;
```

### üëâ **null**

It‚Äôs just a special value which represents ‚Äúnothing‚Äù, ‚Äúempty‚Äù or ‚Äúvalue unknown‚Äù.

```JavaScript
let hobby = null;
```

### üëâ **Symbol**

Details in objects section

# Day -3

## **‚ö° Numbers**

In modern JavaScript, there are two types of numbers:

- Regular numbers in JavaScript are stored in 64-bit format IEEE-754, also known as ‚Äúdouble precision floating point numbers‚Äù.i.e poisitve,negetive and decimal numbers
- Big Init

### **üî• Ways to Write a Number**

**‚û°Ô∏è Big Numbers**

```JavaScript
let oneBillion = 1000000000; // normal method
let newOneBillion = 1e9; // e9 = Nine Zeros
let bigNum1 = 7300000000; // method 1
let bigNum2 = 7.3e9; //  special method

1e3 === 1 * 1000; // 1000
1.32e6 === 1.32 * 1000000;
```

**‚û°Ô∏è Small Numbers**

```JavaScript
let smallNumber = 0.00001; // normal method
let smallNumber1 = 1e-5; // 0.00001 Five zeroes to the left from 1
1e-5 === 1 / 100000; // 0.00001
1.32 - 5 === 1.32 / 100000; // 0.0000132
```

**‚û°Ô∏è Hexadecimal Numbers**

Hexadecimal numbers are widely used in JavaScript to represent colors, encode characters, and for many other things

```JavaScript
let hex = 0xff; // 255
```

### **üî• Number Methods :**

**üéÉ 1. Method ‚û° `toString(base) :`**

The method num.toString(base) returns a string representation of num in the numeral system with the given base. 
- `base=16 :` is used for hex colors, character encodings etc, digits can be 0..9 or A..F.
 - `base=2 :` is mostly for debugging bitwise operations, digits can be 0 or 1.
 - `base=36 :` is the maximum, digits can be 0..9 or A..Z

```JavaScript
 let num1 = 1234;
console.log(num1.toString(16)); // 4d2

let num2 = 5678;
console.log(num2.toString(2)); // 1011000101110

console.log((9101112).toString(32)); // 8lnpo

/**** Please note that two dots in
  123456..toString(36) is not a typo. If we want to
 call a method directly on a number,
 like toString in the example above,
  then we need to place two dots .. after  *****/
```
**üéÉ 2. Rounding**

One of the most used operations when working with numbers is rounding.

- methods are :

  - `Math.floor :` "Rounds Down" e.g - 3.1 to 3 ;-1.1 to -2
  - `Math.ceil :` "Rounds Up" e.g- 3.1 to 4 ; -1.1 to -1
  - `Math.round :` "Rounds to the nearset integer" e.g - 3.1 to 3 ; 3.6 to 4; 3.5 to 4 too.
  - `Math.random() :` Returns a random number from 0 to 1 (not including 1) e.g 0.1234567894322
  - `Math.pow(n, power) :` Returns n raised to the given power. e.g `alert( Math.pow(2, 10) ); // 2 in power 10 = 1024`

  Prob: 1.234567 and want to round it to 2 digits, getting only 1.23
  sol: There are Multiple Ways to do it

  - Multiply And Devide

```JavaScript
console.log(Math.round(1.234567 * 100)/100); // 1.234567 * 100 > 123.4567 (Math.floor method) > 123 (devided by 100) > 1.23

```
**üéÉ 3. Method ‚û° `toFixed(n) :`**

The method toFixed(n) rounds the number to n digits after the point and returns a string representation of the result.

```JavaScript
let number = 13.342;
console.log(number.toFixed(1)); // 13.3
console.log(number.toFixed(2)); // 13.34
console.log(number.toFixed(3)); // 13.342
console.log(number.toFixed(4)); // 13.3420 /*Please note that result of toFixed is a string. If the decimal part is shorter than required, zeroes are appended to the end:*/

/*This rounds up or down to the nearest value, similar to Math.round:*/
let number1 = 13.36679;
console.log(number1.toFixed(1)); // 13.4
console.log(number1.toFixed(2)); // 13.37
console.log(number1.toFixed(3)); // 13.367
console.log(number1.toFixed(4)); // 13.3668
```
**üéÉ 4. Method ‚û° `parseInt & parseFloat:`**

this method read‚Äù a number from a string until they can‚Äôt.Converts a string to a numnber . The function parseInt returns an integer, whilst parseFloat will return a floating-point number:

```JavaScript
console.log(parseInt("100px")); // 100
console.log(parseInt("12em")); // 12
console.log(parseInt("a127")); // NaN ; First symbol stops the process;


console.log(parseFloat('12.2em')); // 12.2
console.log(parseFloat('12.2.6em')); // 12.2

```

here parseInt() function has an optional second parameter. It specifies the base of the numeral system, so parseInt can also parse strings of hex numbers, binary numbers and so on:

```JavaScript
/* parseInt(str ,base)*/
let num = "133"
console.log(parseInt(num,16)) // 307

```
### **üî• Imprecise calculations**

So, there is wired thig here

```JavaScript
console.log(0.1+0.2) // Expected 0.3
(0.1+0.2 === 0.3) // false
console.log(0.1+0.2) // 0.30000000000000004
```

***But why This happens :*** A Number is stored in memoy in binary form , a sequence of bits i.e 0 & 1 but fractions like 0.1 ans 0.2 that look simple in decimal numeric system but actually unEnding fractions in their binary form. e.g
`0.1 = 1/10` but `1/3=0.3333(3)endlessfraction` So, division by powers 10 is guaranteed to work well in the decimal system, but division by 3 is not. For the same reason, in the binary numeral system, the division by powers of 2 is guaranteed to work, but 1/10 becomes an endless binary fraction.There‚Äôs just no way to store exactly 0.1 or exactly 0.2 using the binary system, just like there is no way to store one-third as a decimal fraction.

#### **‚úî Solution of the problem**

```JavaScript
/* By toFixed method*/
let sum = 0.1 + 0.2;
console.log(sum.toFixed(2)); //"0.30" (String)
console.log(+sum.toFixed(2)); //0.30 (Number)

/*By multiply and division*/

console.log((0.1 * 100 + 0.2 * 100) / 100); //0.3
```
### **üî• Converting to number data types**

Sometimes we need to extract a number embded in strings i.e in "" . Specially when a user puts a number in a form . The method is `Number()`. Because the `+` operators convert numbers to strings. Details Below `Data type conversion` section.

```JavaScript
let userInput = "12";
let sum = "12" + 3;
console.log(sum); // 123 (`+` operator converts 3 as a string )

console.log(Number(userInput) + 3); // 15
```
### **üî• Data type conversion**

JavaScript is dynamically typed language so we dont need to specify the data type of a variable when we decleare a variable. So that means data types are autometically converted as-needed during code execution. Example below.

```JavaScript
let rollNumber = 7; // Number
rollNumber = "Seven"; // converted and reassigened as string
console.log(rollNumber);

let userInput = "13";
let sum = "13" + 3;
let negetive = "13" - 3;
console.log(sum); // 133 (3 is converted as string)
console.log(negetive); //10 ( here 3 is act as a number)
```

As seen the `+` operator is only converts numbers as string but others not.

## **‚ö° Basic operators, maths**

Before jump into operators lets learn some basic terms i.e `operand`,`operator`
`Operand`: In which the operator applied. e.g `5-3`here the two operand are `5`,`3`. & `-` is the `Operator`

```JavaScript
let num1 = 2;
num1= -num1;
console.log(num1); // -2 single operand pressent thats why this operator is unary

let num2 = 5;
let num3 = 7;
console.log(num3 - num2); // 2 two operand(num2,num3) present  thats why this operatr is called binary operator

```

### Main Operator Types

- Assignment operators
- Arithmetic Operators
- Comparison Operators
- Logical Operators
- Increment Operator
- Decrement Operator
- Ternary Operators
- Operator Precendence

### Assignment Operator

Assignment operators are operators that assign a value to a variable.

#### Types -

- = => x=4 , y=3
- (Addition assignment) += => x+=y => x=x+y; // 7
- (Subtraction assignment) -+ => x-=y => x=x-y; // 1
- (Multiplication assignment) _= => x_=y => x=x\*y; // 12
- (Division assignment) /= => x/=y => x=x/y; // 1.3333
- (Modulus assignment) %= => x%=y => x=x%y; // 1

### Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are the basic operators that we use to do sums in JavaScript:

#### Types -

- - => x+y; // 7
- - => x-y; // 1
- - => x\*y; // 12
- / => x/y; // 1.3333
- % => x%y; // 1
- ** => x**y // 64

### Comparison Operators

Sometimes we will want to run true/false tests, then act accordingly depending on the result of that test ‚Äî to do this we use comparison operators.

#### Types -

- === -> Strict equality | Tests whether the left and right values are identical to one Another
- !== -> Strict-non-equality | Tests whether the left and right values are not identical to one Another
- < -> Less than | Tests whether the left value is smaller than the right one.
- > -> Greater than | Tests whether the left value is greater than the right one.
- <= -> Less than or equal to | Tests whether the left value is smaller than or equal to the right one.
- > = -> Greater than or equal to | Tests whether the left value is greater than or equal to the right one.

```JavaScript
console.log(3==="3"); // false
console.log(3===3); // true
console.log(3=="3"); // true
console.log(3!==3); // false
console.log(3<2); // false
console.log(3>2); // true
console.log(3>=2); // true
console.log(3<=2); // false
console.log("mango".length == "milk".length ); // false
console.log("pizza".length == "juice".length); // true
```

### Logical operators

#### Types -

- && -> The && operator gets true only if the two operands are true.
- || -> The || operator gets true either of the operand is true.
- ! -> The ! operator negates true to false and false to true.

```JavaScript
// && Example
let check = 5>3 && 7>5
console.log(check); // true (both are true)
let check1 = 5>3 && 7>8;
console.log(check1); // false ( 7>8 is false)
let check2 = 5<3 && 9<8;
console.log(check2);// false (both false)
// || Example
let check3 = 5>3 || 7>5;
console.log(check3);// true ( both true)
let check4 = 5>3 || 7>8;
console.log(check4); // true ( 5>3 is true so neat result also true )
let check5 = 5<3 || 9<8 ;
console.log(check5); // false (both false)
// ! Example
let check6 = 5>3;
console.log(check6); // true
let check7 = !(5>3);
console.log(check7); // false (converts true to false)
```

### Increment and decrement operators

Sometimes you'll want to repeatedly add or subtract one to or from a numeric variable value. This can be conveniently done using the increment (++) and decrement (--) operators.

### Increment

```JavaScript

//Post Increment
let number = 2;
 number++
console.log(number); // 3
//Pre Increment
let number1 = 2;
++number1;
console.log(number1); // 3

```

### Decrement

```JavaScript
//Post Decrement
let number2 = 2;
number2--;
console.log(number2); // 1
// Pre Decrement
let number3 = 2;
--number3;
console.log(number3); // 1
```

## Ternary operator

The conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands: a condition followed by a question mark (?), then an expression to execute if the condition is truthy followed by a colon (:), and finally the expression to execute if the condition is falsy. This operator is frequently used as an alternative to an if...else statement.

### Syntax:

```JavaScript
condition ? exprIfTrue : exprIfFalse
```

### Example

```JavaScript
let isSweet = true;
isSweet ? `It is sweet` : `It is not Sweet`; // 'It is Sweet'

isSweet = false;
isSweet ? `It is Sweet` : `It is not Sweet`; // 'It is not Sweet'

let name = "pritam";
let drink = (name === "pritam" ) ? `tea` : `coffee`;
console.log(drink); // 'tea'
drink = (name === "priya") ? `tea` : `coffee`;
console.log(drink); // 'coffee'
```

## Day-4

### Making decisions in your code - Conditionals

Conditional statements are used for make decisions based on different conditions. By default , statements in JavaScript script executed sequentially from top to bottom.

Conditions can be implementing using the following ways:

- if
- if..else
- if Else if Else
- switch

### if

The if(...) statement evaluates a condition in parentheses and, if the result is true, executes a block of code.

#### Syntax:

```JavaScript
// syntax
if (condition) {
  //this part of code runs for truthy condition
}
```

#### Example:

```JavaScript
let age = 17;
if (age>=18) {
console.log("You can Enter")
}; // No output as it is false
let newAge = 19;
if (newAge>=18) {
	console.log("You can Enter")
}; // You can Enter

```

### if..else

If condition is true the first block will be executed, if not the else condition will be executed.

#### Syntax:

```JavaScript
if (condition) {
   statement1  // this part of code runs for truthy condition
} else {
   statement2 // this part of code runs for false condition
}

```

#### Example:

```JavaScript
let age = 16;
if (age>=18) {
	console.log("You can Drink Beer")
} else {
	console.log("You can Drink Juice")
} // You can Drink Juice
```

### If Else if else

Multiple if...else statements can be nested to create an else if clause. Note that there is no elseif (in one word) keyword in JavaScript.

#### Syntax:

```JavaScriptif (condition1)
  statement1
else if (condition2)
  statement2
else if (condition3)
  statement3
...
else
  statementN
```

#### Example:

```JavaScript

let int = 12;
if(int>0){
	console.log("It is Positive Number");
}else if(int<0){
	console.log("It is a negetive number");
}else if(int === 0){
	console.log("It is Zero");
}else{
	console.log("It is not a number");
}; // It is a Positive Number
```

### Switch Stament

A switch statement can replace multiple if checks.
It gives a more descriptive way to compare a value with multiple variants.

### Syntax:

The switch has one or more case blocks and an optional default.

It looks like this:

```JavaScript
switch(x) {
  case 'value1':  // if (x === 'value1')
    ...
    [break]

  case 'value2':  // if (x === 'value2')
    ...
    [break]

  default:
    ...
    [break]
}
```

### Example:

```JavaScript
let fruit = "mango";

switch(fruit){
case "orange":
 console.log("orange's are orange");
 break;
case "banana":
 console.log("banana's are yellow");
 break;
case "guava":
 console.log("guava's are green");
 break;
default:
 console.log("sorry " + fruit + " is not in the database");
}; // sorry mango is not in the databse

```

### Looping Code

Loops are all about doing the same thing over and over again. Often, the code will be slightly different each time round the loop, or the same code will run but with different variables.

### Types:

- for loop
- while loop
- do while loop
- for of loop
- break & continue

#### for loop

### Syntax:

```JavaScript
for (initializer; condition; final-expression) {
  // code to run
}
```

#### Examples:

```JavaScript
for(i=0;i<5;i++){
	console.log(i);
};
```

In the above for loop, the statement start by declaring & initializing i to 0; then it checks i less than 5 and execute statements.and increments i after each pass though the loop.

The declearation of i in the head of for loop is optional , and the conditional block is also optional we can skip all examples below

```JavaScript
/*Optional for expressions*/
// optional initialization

let i = 0;
for(;i<7;i++){
	console.log(i);
};
//optional condition block
for (let i = 0;; i++) {
   console.log(i);
   if (i > 3) break;
   // more statements
}
//omit all
let i = 0;

for (;;) {
  if (i > 3) break;
  console.log(i);
  i++;
}
```

#### While loop

#### Syntax:

```JavaScript
initializer
while (condition) {
  // code to run

  final-expression
}
```

#### Examples:

```JavaScript
let i = 0;
while(i<3){ // 0 1 2
console.log(i);
i++
}

let x = 5;
while(x){ // when x becomes 0 the loop stops
console.log(x);

#### do..while loop

The do...while loop is very similar, but provides a variation on the while structure:

#### Syntax:

```JavaScript
initializer
do {
  // code to run

  final-expression
} while (condition)
```

#### Examples:

```JavaScript
// Basic Example:
let i = 0;
do{
 console.log(i);
 i++
}while(i<6);
// New Example

let cars = ["Tesla","BMW","TATA","Mustang","Zeep"];
let myFavCars = "My Favorite Cars are ";
let i =0;
do{
 if( i === cars.length - 1 ){
	 myFavCars += `and ${cars[i]}.`
 }else{
   myFavCars += `${cars[i]}, `;
 }
  i++
}while(i < cars.length);
console.log(myFavCars); // My Favorite Cars are Tesla, BMW, TATA, Mustang and Jeep.
```

#### break & continue

Break is used to interrupt a loop. & We use the keyword continue to skip a certain iterations.

#### Examples:

```JavaScript
/* Break */
for(let i = 0; i <= 5; i++){
  if(i == 3){
    break
  }
  console.log(i)
}

// 0 1 2
/* Continue */
for(let i = 0; i <= 5; i++){
  if(i == 3){
    continue
  }
  console.log(i)
}

// 0 1 2 4 5
```
